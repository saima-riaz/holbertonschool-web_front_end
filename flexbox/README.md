# Flexbox Introducation
Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model designed to make it easier to create flexible and responsive layouts. It allows you to arrange items in a container, distributing space dynamically and aligning items in ways that were difficult or cumbersome with older layout methods like floats or inline-block.
Flexbox is particularly useful for creating complex layouts with minimal code, and it adapts well to different screen sizes and content dimensions.
# Key Features:
- Flexible Layouts: Items can grow, shrink, and be spaced automatically to fill available space.
- Alignment Control: Easily align items both vertically and horizontally, without needing complex CSS or extra HTML.
- Responsive Design:Simplifies the creation of responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
# Common Properties:
- justify-content: Controls the alignment of items along the main axis.
- align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis.
- flex-direction: Defines the direction of the flex items (row, column, etc.).
- flex-wrap: Determines whether items should wrap onto multiple lines.
