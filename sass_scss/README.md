## Introduction to Sass and SCSS
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a powerful extension of CSS that adds features like variables, nesting, and functions to enhance the efficiency and maintainability of your stylesheets. It allows you to write cleaner, more organized CSS and makes it easier to manage complex styles.

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a syntax of Sass that is fully compatible with CSS. It allows you to write CSS code while taking advantage of Sass features. SCSS files have the .scss extension, and you can use all CSS features directly, while also being able to include Sass-specific enhancements.
